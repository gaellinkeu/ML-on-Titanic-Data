## Approach
Differents Algorithms to best predict is a passenger on titanic would have died or lived
Models implemented

### Simple Models
* Naive Bayes
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Support vector Machine

### Ensemble Models
* Random forest
* Adaboost
* Gradient Boosting
* Stacking (manual and automatic stacking, voting)
